/**
 * React context exposing the resolved wildcard item to descendant
 * renderings. The `wildcard-experience@1` wrapper is the only
 * producer: it resolves `<SourceRoot>/<slug>` ONCE via
 * `useWildcardItem` and provides the whole {@link WildcardItemState}
 * (status + item + field map) here, so any component composed inside
 * its `wildcard-content-{*}` placeholder can bind resolved fields
 * without firing its own Edge lookup.
 *
 * Consumers are not written by hand per component — the generic
 * consumer lives at the `withSitecore` seam: when a rendering carries
 * a `WildcardBindings` rendering param (a JSON map of prop name →
 * resolved field name) AND this context holds a resolved item, the
 * adapter overlays the mapped resolved fields onto the final props
 * (see `applyWildcardBindings` in ./bindings.ts).
 *
 * Mirrors `search-controller-context.tsx`: provider-optional — when no
 * provider is mounted (every non-wildcard page, the showcase preview,
 * editing mode) `useWildcardItemContext` returns `null` and the
 * mechanism is inert; authored datasource content renders unchanged.
